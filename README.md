# HP Firmware Update Project
I'm tasked with figuring out a way to push HP driver updates to endpoint user laptops in the company.

## Summary
Need to develop a process for maintaining and deploying HP drivers to our laptop fleet. Not all drivers are released via windows update so using the driver update ring in Intune is not as ideal but could be an option to investigate. 

Also found the following blog posts that utilize HP Image assistant in conjunction with Intune to push out driver updates, this looks promising but will require research and testing.
